In Swift, zero and infinity (available as the static property `infinity`) behave
as they do in other languages. The sign of zero or infinity can be changed using
the prefix operator `-`.

In Swift, the static property `nan` is a quiet NaN of the corresponding binary
floating-point type, and the static property `signalingNaN` is a signaling NaN
of that type. The instance property `isNaN` evaluates to `true` for any NaN
value, quiet or signaling; the instance property `isSignalingNaN` evaluates to
`true` only for a signaling NaN.

It is possible to create a particular encoding of NaN by using the initializer
`init(nan:signaling:)`, where the first argument is the payload and the second
is a Boolean value to indicate whether the result should be a signaling NaN. To
change the sign of NaN, use the prefix operator `-`.

IEEE 754-2008 specifies that, for encodings of NaN, the most significant bit of
the significand field is a flag that is nonzero if the NaN is quiet and zero if
the NaN is signaling. All remaining bits of the significand field are part of
the payload.

However, Swift also reserves the second-most significant bit of the significand
field as a flag; that bit is nonzero when NaN is signaling. (The converse is not
true: if the most significant bit of the significand field is nonzero, then NaN
is quiet, as required by IEEE 754-2008, regardless of the value of the
second-most significant bit.)

Therefore, the maximum bit width of the NaN payload is one less than that
specified by IEEE 754-2008. For example, a runtime error results when attempting
to use a 51-bit payload for a NaN of type `Double`:

```swift
Double(nan: 1 << 50, signaling: false)
// Fatal error: NaN payload is not encodable
```

However, if a `Double` value with such a payload is initialized by other means,
Swift does correctly treat the value as a quiet NaN:

```swift
let x = Double(bitPattern: 0x7ffc000000000000)
(x.isNaN, x.isSignalingNaN)  // (true, false)
```

When an operation required by IEEE 754 returns NaN, its exact encoding is not
specified by the standard. In Swift, the encoding can vary based on the
underlying architecture, and results may not match that obtained in C/C++ on the
same machine.

For example, in Swift on x86_64 macOS:

```swift
let x = -Double.nan
let y = x + 0

print(x.bitPattern == y.bitPattern)
// Prints "false"
```

By contrast, in C on x86_64 macOS:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

union f64 {
  uint64_t u64;
  double d;
};

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
  union f64 x;
  x.d = -nan("");
  union f64 y;
  y.d = x.d + 0.;

  printf("%s\n", x.u64 == y.u64 ? "true" : "false");
  return 0;
}
// Prints "true"
```

### Describing NaN

In Swift, any NaN value is described as "nan":

```swift
Double.nan.description                   // "nan"
(-Double.nan).description                // "nan"
Double.signalingNaN.description          // "nan"
(-Double.signalingNaN).description       // "nan"
Double(nan: 1, signaling: false)
  .description                           // "nan"
```

The debug description can be used to obtain more information about the sign and
payload of NaN values:

```swift
Double.nan.debugDescription              // "nan"
(-Double.nan).debugDescription           // "-nan"
Double.signalingNaN.debugDescription     // "snan"
(-Double.signalingNaN).debugDescription  // "-snan"
Double(nan: 1, signaling: false)
  .debugDescription                      // "nan(0x1)"
```

These debug descriptions round-trip correctly when converted back to the
floating-point type:

```swift
Double("snan")!.isSignalingNaN 
// true
Double("nan(0x1)")!.isNaN
// true
String(Double("nan(0x1)")!.bitPattern, radix: 16)
// 7ff8000000000001
```

### Minimum, maximum, and total order

The global functions `Swift.min(_:_:)` and `Swift.max(_:_:)` are available for
comparing two values of any `Comparable` type. Because these functions rely on
semantic guarantees violated by NaN, their behavior is unusual when one of the
arguments is NaN:

```swift
Swift.min(Double.nan, 0) // NaN
Swift.min(0, Double.nan) // 0
```

The operations __minNum__ and __maxNum__ are defined in the IEEE 754-2008
standard and __favor numbers over quiet NaN__. (If any argument is a
_signaling_ NaN, however, the result is NaN; [in a future version of
Swift][ref 16-2], the standard library will also favor numbers over signaling
NaN.) These operations are available in Swift as the static methods
`T.minimum(_:_:)` and `T.maximum(_:_:)`, where `T` is a floating-point type:

```swift
Double.minimum(.nan, 0) // 0
Double.minimum(0, .nan) // 0
```

Note that `-0.0` and `0.0` are considered substitutable _for the purposes of
these operations_:

```swift
Double.minimum(-0.0, 0.0) // -0.0
Double.minimum(0.0, -0.0) // 0.0
```

Analogous operations to compare the magnitudes of two floating-point values are
known as __minNumMag__ and __maxNumMag__ in the IEEE 754-2008 standard and are
available in Swift as `T.minimumMagnitude(_:_:)` and `T.maximumMagnitude(_:_:)`,
respectively.

A __total order__ for all possible representations in a floating-point type is
defined in IEEE 754-2008. Recall that, using standard operators, NaN compares
not equal to, not less than, and not greater than any value, and `-0.0` and
`0.0` compare equal to each other. The total ordering defined in IEEE 754-2008,
however, places `-0.0` below `0.0`, positive NaN above positive infinity, and
negative NaN below negative infinity. It further distinguishes encodings of NaN
by their signaling bit and payload. Specifically:

- A quiet NaN is ordered above a signaling NaN if both are positive, and vice
  versa if both are negative.
- An encoding of NaN with larger payload (when interpreted as an integer) is
  ordered above an encoding of NaN with smaller payload if both are positive,
  and vice versa if both are negative.

This total order is available in Swift as the method
`isTotallyOrdered(belowOrEqualTo:)`. As clarified in the name,
`x.isTotallyOrdered(belowOrEqualTo: y)` returns `true` if `x` orders below
or equal to `y` in the total order prescribed in the IEEE 754-2008 standard.

## Floating-point remainder

> _Background:_
>
> IEEE 754 specifies a remainder operation that has behavior unlike that of the
> binary integer remainder operation.

In Swift, as in other languages, two similar remainder operations exist for
floating-point types:

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="1">

|          | Nearest-to-zero remainder  | Truncating remainder |
|----------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Swift    | <code class="manual-escape">x.remainder(<br />dividingBy: y)</code> | <code class="manual-escape">x.truncatingRemainder(<br />dividingBy: y)</code> |
| C        | `remainder(x, y)`          | `fmod(x, y)`         |
| C#       | `Math.IEEERemainder(x, y)` | `x % y`              |
| Java     | `Math.IEEEremainder(x, y)` | `x % y`              |
| Kotlin   | `x.IEEErem(y)`             | `x % y`              |

</div>

> In early versions of Swift, the truncating remainder operation was spelled
> `%`. However, it was thought that users often used the operator incorrectly,
> so it was removed from floating-point types in the Swift Evolution proposal
> [SE-0067: Enhanced floating-point protocols][ref 11-10].

A simple example is sufficient to illustrate the difference between the two
operations:

```swift
(-8).remainder(dividingBy: 5)           // 2
(-8).truncatingRemainder(dividingBy: 5) // -3
```

The __nearest-to-zero remainder__ of _x_ dividing by _y_ is the exact result _r_
such that _x_ = _y_&nbsp;×&nbsp;_q_&nbsp;+&nbsp;_r_, where _q_ is the nearest
integer value to _x_&nbsp;÷&nbsp;_y_. (The actual computation is performed
without intermediate rounding and _q_ does not need to be representable as a
value of any type.) Notice that __the result could be positive or negative,
regardless of the sign of the operands__; the magnitude of the result is no more
than half of the magnitude of the divisor (_y_).

The __truncating remainder__ of _x_ dividing by _y_ is the exact result _s_ such
that _x_ = _y_&nbsp;×&nbsp;_p_&nbsp;+&nbsp;_s_, where _p_ is the result of
_x_&nbsp;÷&nbsp;_y_ rounded toward zero to an integer value. (The actual
computation is performed without intermediate rounding and _p_ does not need to
be representable as value of any type.) Notice that __the sign of the result is
the same as that of the dividend (_x_)__; the magnitude of the result is always
less than the magnitude of the divisor (_y_).

For both operations, the remainder of dividing an infinite value by any value,
or of dividing any value by zero, is NaN.

Any Swift binary floating-point type `T` has several members related to the
significand of a value `x`:

* __`T.significandBitCount`__  
  The number of available __fractional__ significand bits, or `Int.max` if there
  is no limit (i.e., if `T` is an arbitrary precision type).  
  Whether implicit or explicit, the most significant place of the significand
  represents its integral part and is excluded from this reckoning. Therefore,
  `Float.significandBitCount` is `23` and `Float80.significandBitCount` is `63`.

* __`x.significand`__  
  A value that can be used to compute the magnitude of `x` by multiplication
  with `exp2(T(x.exponent))`.  
  Note that the sign of `significand` is always positive for this purpose;
  therefore, you will need `sign`, `exponent`, and `significand` to recreate a
  decomposed floating-point value.  
  If `x` is finite and nonzero, the result is always in the range `1..<2`. (If
  `x` is subnormal, its significand bit pattern is shifted so that the leading
  nonzero bit is in the most significant place of the significand in order to
  produce the result.)  
  If `x` is zero, infinite, or NaN, then the result is positive zero, positive
  infinity, or NaN, respectively.

* __`x.significandWidth`__  
  The number of __fractional__ significand bits required to represent the
  significand of `x`; `x.significandWidth` never exceeds
  `T.significandBitCount`.  
  Whether implicit or explicit, the leading nonzero bit is excluded from this
  reckoning; this applies even when `x` is subnormal (when the leading nonzero
  bit is always explicitly stored in memory), since `x.significand` would be in
  the range `1..<2` and therefore a normal value. For example,
  `T.leastNonzeroMagnitude` has _one_ nonzero significand bit, and
  `T.leastNonzeroMagnitude.significandWidth` is `0`.  
  Meanwhile, `(0 as T)` has _zero_ nonzero significand bits, and
  `(0 as T).significandWidth` is `-1`. If `x` is infinite or NaN,
  `x.significandWidth` is also `-1`.

* __`x.significandBitPattern`__  
  The __fractional__ significand bits of `x`; you can recreate a floating-point
  value from its `sign`, `exponentBitPattern`, and `significandBitPattern` using
  the initializer `init(sign:exponentBitPattern:significandBitPattern:)`.  
  The significand bit pattern is obtained by bit masking the raw encoding of
  `x`; if the most significant place of the significand (representing the
  integral part) is explicitly stored (as it is in values of type `Float80`),
  that is excluded by the bit masking operation. However, if `x` is subnormal,
  the explicitly stored leading nonzero bit is not in the most significant place
  of the significand and is therefore __not excluded__; for example,
  `T.leastNonzeroMagnitude.significandBitPattern` is `1`.

> It has been [erroneously documented][ref 18-1] that `T.infinity.significand`
> is `1`. Although that may have been the originally intended behavior, Swift's
> implementations for concrete types have never behaved in that way.
