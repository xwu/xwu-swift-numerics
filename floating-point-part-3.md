Concrete binary floating-point types, part 3
============================================

## Integer literals (redux)

All floating-point types in Swift conform to the protocol
`ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral`. Therefore, it's possible to create a new
floating-point value using an __integer literal__.

Earlier, [nuances about the use of integer literals](integers-part-1.md#integer-literals)
were discussed that apply equally when they are used to express floating-point
values. One issue is especially salient for our purposes here:

Recall that integer literals do not support signed zero (in other words,
`-0 as Float` evaluates to positive zero). Either use parentheses, as in
`-(0 as Float)`, or use a __float literal__ as discussed below, to obtain the
desired value.

## Float literals

A __float literal__ in Swift is similar to analogous expressions in other "C
family" languages. It can be written in either base 10 or base 16 (hexadecimal).

> _Background:_
>
> In Swift, as in other "C family" languages, the whole part of a base 10 float
> literal can be followed by a fractional part beginning with a decimal
> separator dot (`.`), a decimal exponent beginning with `e` or `E`, or both (in
> that order). The digits of the exponent can optionally be preceded by `-` or
> `+`.
>
> As with integer literals, float literals can be prepended with the
> hyphen-minus character (`-`) to indicate a negative value.

__In Swift, a float literal cannot begin or end with a decimal separator dot.__
For example:

```swift
let x = .5
// error: '.5' is not a valid floating point literal; it must be written '0.5'
let y = 5.
// error: expected member name following '.'
```

(Instead, Swift uses leading dot syntax for implicit member lookup.)

> The same requirement does not apply to conversions from `String`. For example,
> `Double(".5")! == 0.5`.

### Hexadecimal float literals

Unfamiliar to some users, hexadecimal float literals (also specified in C99 and
and C++17) are supported in Swift. They can be useful when you want to represent
the intended binary floating-point value exactly and a decimal literal is
impractical or impossible for the purpose.

Hexadecimal float literals use the base prefix `0x`. Then, the whole part (in
base 16) can optionally be followed by a fractional part (also in base 16)
beginning with the separator dot (`.`). Finally, __hexadecimal float literals
must end with a binary exponent__ beginning with `p` or `P`. The digits of the
exponent can optionally be preceded by `-` or `+`. For example:

```swift
let x = 0x1p2
// 1.0 * (2 ** 2) == 4
// Here, we use `**` to represent exponentiation.

let y = 0x1p-2
// 1.0 * (2 ** -2) == 0.25 

let z = 0x1.8p-1
// (1.0 + 8/16) * (2 ** -1) == 0.75

let a = 0xf.fffp-3
// (15.0 + 15/16 + 15/256 + 15/4096) * (2 ** -3)
//   == 1.999969482421875 
```

> In C, the binary exponent is not optional to avoid ambiguity between the
> hexadecimal digit `f` and a suffix `f` indicating that the constant has type
> `float`. In Swift, the binary exponent isn't optional even though there is no
> possibility of ambiguity.

As with integer literals, hexadecimal float literals can be prepended with the
hyphen-minus character (`-`) to indicate a negative value.

__In Swift, the portion of a hexadecimal float literal between the required base
prefix and the required binary exponent cannot begin or end with the separator
dot (`.`).__ At the time of writing, error messages are not particularly helpful
in diagnosing the issue:

```swift
let x = 0x1.p2
// error: value of type 'Int' has no member 'p2'
let y = 0x.1p2
// error: '.' is not a valid hexadecimal digit (0-9, A-F) in integer literal
// error: 'p' is not a valid digit in integer literal
// error: consecutive statements on a line must be separated by ';'
// error: expected identifier after '.' expression
```

> Again, the same requirement does not apply to conversions from `String`.

### Type inference

As previously discussed, literals have no type of their own in Swift. Instead,
the type checker attempts to infer the type of a literal expression based on
other available information such as explicit type annotations.

Besides using an explicit type annotation, the __type coercion__ operator `as`
[(which is to be distinguished from __dynamic cast__ operators `as?`, `as!`, and
`is`)][ref 3-1] can be used to provide information for type inference:

```swift
let x = 42.0 as Float
```

In the absence of other available information, the inferred type of a float
literal expression defaults to `FloatLiteralType`, which is a type alias for
`Double` unless it is shadowed by the user.

### Float literal precision

Notionally, a numeric literal isn't limited by the precision of any type because
it has no type.

Under the hood, however, a float literal is first used to create an internal
value of type `_MaxBuiltinFloatType`, which is then converted to the intended
type. As of the time of writing, __float literals may be incorrectly rounded__
because `_MaxBuiltinFloatType` is a type alias for `Float80` if supported and
`Double` otherwise. Consequently, float literals that cannot be represented
exactly as a value of type `_MaxBuiltinFloatType` are subject to
__double-rounding error__ just as though the value were created using a
converting initializer.

Hexadecimal float literals of no more than the maximum supported precision can
be used to avoid this double-rounding error for binary floating-point types.

> Previously, an integer literal was likewise first used to create an internal
> 2048-bit value (of type `_MaxBuiltinIntegerType`), which was then converted to
> the intended type. In November 2018, the integer literal type was changed from
> a fixed 2048-bit type to [an arbitrary width type][ref 13-0].

> Double rounding of float literals is tracked by Swift bug [SR-7124:
> Double rounding in floating-point literal conversion][ref 13-1].

Since `_MaxBuiltinFloatType` is a _binary_ floating-point type, a _decimal_
floating-point type that conforms to the protocol `ExpressibleByFloatLiteral`
cannot distinguish between two values that have the same binary floating-point
representation when rounded to fit `_MaxBuiltinFloatType`:

```swift
import Foundation

(0.1 as Decimal).description
// "0.1"
(0.10000000000000001 as Decimal).description
// "0.1"

Decimal(string: "0.1")!.description
// "0.1"
Decimal(string: "0.10000000000000001")!.description
// "0.10000000000000001"
```

## Conversions among floating-point types

Two different initializers are provided for conversions between standard library
binary floating-point types. A value of `source` of type `T` can be converted to
a value of type `U` as follows:

1. __`U(source)`__  
   Converts the given value to a representable value of type `U`.  
   The result of an __inexact__ conversion is rounded to the nearest
   representable value.  
   The result of an __overflowing__ conversion is infinite.  
   The result of an __underflowing__ conversion is zero.  
   The result of converting __NaN__ is some encoding of NaN that varies based on
   the underlying architecture; any __signaling NaN__ is always converted to a
   quiet NaN.

1. __`U(exactly: source)`__  
   _Failable initializer._   
   Converts the given value if it can be represented "exactly" as a value of
   type `U`; any result that is not `nil` can be converted back to a value of
   type `T` that compares equal to `source`.  
   The result of an __inexact__ conversion is `nil`.  
   The result of an __overflowing__ conversion is `nil`.  
   The result of an __underflowing__ conversion is `nil`.  
   The result of converting __NaN__ (however encoded) is `nil`, since NaN never
   compares equal to NaN.

## Other initializers

### Creating from a string

Standard library binary floating-point types provide an unlabeled failable
initializer that creates a binary floating-point value based on a given string:

```swift
let pi = Double("3.14159265358979323846")!
// 3.1415926535897931
```

Any spelling that's valid as an integer or float literal is valid as a string
for conversion to a binary floating-point type. Likewise, any value obtained
from the `description` or `debugDescription` property of a binary floating-point
value is valid for conversion. Specifically:

* The string can represent a value in base 10 or base 16 (hexadecimal).
* "Infinity" or "inf" (regardless of case) represents infinity.
* "NaN" (regardless of case) represents NaN, "sNaN" (regardless of case)
  represents signaling NaN, and either may be followed by a parenthesized
  decimal or hexadecimal number that represents the NaN payload.

[Until the behavior is changed][ref 15-1] in a future version of Swift, any
string that would cause a range error when it is used as the argument of the C
function `strtof` or `strtod` causes `Float.init?(_: String)` or
`Double.init?(_: String)` (respectively) to return `nil`. Therefore:

__Any invalid character, even if whitespace, causes the entire string to be
invalid for conversion.__  
The result of an __inexact__ conversion is rounded to the nearest representable
value.  
The result of an __overflowing__ conversion is `nil` (in the future, it will be
infinite).  
The result of an __underflowing__ conversion is `nil` (in the future, it will be
zero).  
The result of converting __NaN__ is encoded with the NaN payload (truncated if
needed) if such a payload is specified.

> Although an _integer literal_ beginning with a leading zero isn't considered
> to be written in base 8 (octal), a _NaN payload_ beginning with a leading zero
> _is_ considered to be written in base 8:
>
> ```swift 
> let x = Double("nan(123)")!
> let y = Double("nan(0123)")!
>
> String(x.bitPattern, radix: 16) // "7ff800000000007b"
> String(y.bitPattern, radix: 16) // "7ff8000000000053"
>
> String(123, radix: 16)          // "7b"
> String(0o123, radix: 16)        // "53"
> ```

Some rules are more relaxed for string conversion than for float literals: a
digit is not required to precede or follow the separator dot, and a binary
exponent is not required to end a hexadecimal value:

```swift
let x = Double(".5")!
// 0.5
let y = Double("5.")!
// 5
let z = Double("0x1.p2")!
// 4
let a = Double("0x.1p2")!
// 0.25
let b = Double("0x1.")!
// 1
```
